OmniGraffle export scripts

This package provides command-line access to the export functionality
of OmniGraffle.  This allows you, for instance, to automatically
generate the necessary EPS and PDF versions of an OmniGraffle figure
for incorporating into an automatic build system for a LaTeX document.

The package consists of an AppleScript (graffle.scpt), which must be
edited using Apple's Script Editor application, as it's stored in a
binary format.  This AppleScript contains the integration logic for
communicating with OmniGraffle.  As there are two versions of
OmniGraffle available, standard and professional, it takes the
application name as a command-line argument.

A shell script is provided for simplifying the command line interface.
It will try to automatically determine which version of OmniGraffle
you have installed; this will only work if OmniGraffle is installed
into /Applications.  If it is not, you can specify which version to
use by setting the GRAFFLE_APP environment variable to either
"OmniGraffle" or "OmniGraffle Professional".

The usage of the shell script is:

   graffle.sh [<format name>] <input file> <output file>

Both filenames are mandatory.  The format name is optional.  The list
of acceptable format names is not well-documented in the OmniGraffle
reference.  In OmniGraffle 4, it seems that you can certainly use the
list of choices in the "Format" field of OmniGraffle's export dialog
box (e.g., "PNG bitmap image").  Shortcuts also seem to work -- "pdf",
"PDF", "eps", "EPS" have all been verified (under OmniGraffle 4.x) to
produce correct output.  Under OmniGraffle 5, several of these choices
don't work â€” most notably, PDF.

If you leave out <format name>, then OmniGraffle will try to guess the
correct output format based on the extension of <output file>.  This
seems to be more reliable than guessing which <format name> to use,
and seems to work with both OmniGraffle 4 and 5.
